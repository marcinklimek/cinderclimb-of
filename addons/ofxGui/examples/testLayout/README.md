# testLayout

### Purpose

This test application is meant as a tool to test the implementation of `ofxDOMBoxLayout` and `ofxDOMFlexBoxLayout`. If you use simple controls, panels and groups and align them without using special flexbox attributes, both layouts should create the same output. This app adds a set of panels created by each of the layouts and you can switch between the two versions via the toggles on the top. Both versions should look the same, I just added some color differences to be able to see that the switching between the layouts works.
